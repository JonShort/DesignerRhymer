# DesignerRhymer

[DesignerRhymer](https://jonshort.github.io/DesignerRhymer/#/) - a fun repo to share rhymes of my favourite designers - written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Installation
To run this locally:

- `git clone` it somewhere
- Run `yarn`
- Run `yarn run dev`
- That's it!

_don't have Yarn?_ get it [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or use `npm install` and `npm run dev` instead.

## Why does this exist?
I started this repo mainly to get a feel for Vue.js, and decided to have fun creating nicknames for the designers I know.
