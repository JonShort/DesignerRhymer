# DesignerRhymer

Quickly find a rhyming sentance for your favourite designers - written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Installation
To run this locally:

- `git clone` it somewhere
- Run `yarn` _dont have yarn?_ - get it [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Run `yarn dev`
- That's it!

## Why does this exist?
I started this repo mainly to get a feel for Vue.js (being more of a React fan), and decided to have fun creating nicknames for the designers I know.
